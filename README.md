# discord-bots
Some simple discord bots while learning python

TODO/Plans for gamble bot: (Currently done with this bot)

Note that gamble bot sql version still pulls some info (marvel/philo rates) from google sheets. Only user data was changed

 <strike> 1) Merge flip and flip2 into one method. Figure out how to handle "method overloading" with different types of parameters in python  
  2) Learn to read from google sheets and add in marvel/philo  
     - Add in marvel/philo to spin for a specific item  
  3) Add in ability to reset user stats  
  4) Learn to make classes in python and add simple blackjack </strike>

Plans for future bots: Added hilla bot for versus/true hilla timers

<strike> 1) TTS bot? that can join a voice channel and tell you warnings for bosses </strike>
